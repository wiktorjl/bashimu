### About
BASHIMU is a simple bash script to interact with OpenAI's ChatGPT models.



### Setup
In order to use it, you need to set ```$OPENAI_API_KEY``` to your own private key.

You can also set ```$OPENAI_MODEL_NAME``` to the specific model you want to use.

Optionally, you can alias ```bashimu.sh``` to something simpler: ```alias ?=/home/user/bin/bashimu.sh```

This will allow you to type ```? your question```.

Best to do this in you shell's config file, like ```~/.bashrc```.



### Usage:
Executing a query: ```./bashimu.sh your query``` or ```? your query```

Executing the last suggested command: ```./bashimu.sh !``` or ```? !```
