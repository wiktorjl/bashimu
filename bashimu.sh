# bashimu.sh - A simple script to interact with OpenAI's API for bash and Linux related questions
#
# Usage:
#   bashimu.sh <bash or linux related question>
#
# Requirements:
#   - Set the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable with your OpenAI API key.
#   - Optionally, set the OPENAI_MODEL_NAME environment variable to specify the model (default: gpt-4o-mini).
#   - Ensure 'curl' and 'jq' are installed on your system.
#
# Example:
#   bashimu.sh "How do I list all files in a directory?"
#
# This script will send your question to the OpenAI API and return a concise command line answer.
